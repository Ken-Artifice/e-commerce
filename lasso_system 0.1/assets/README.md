# Assets Directory

This directory should contain PWA icons and other static assets.

## Required Icons for PWA

For the Progressive Web App to work properly, you should add:

1. **icon-192.png** - 192x192 pixels icon
2. **icon-512.png** - 512x512 pixels icon

You can create these icons using any image editor or online icon generator. The icons should represent your application.

## Placeholder

If you don't have icons yet, the application will still work, but the PWA installation may not show custom icons.
